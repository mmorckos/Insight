What Is This?
----------------------

SudokuSolver is a C++-based command-line tool for efficiently solving Sudoku puzzles. The program
accepts a properly formatted CSV file containing one or more puzzles and outputs their solutions
into an output file that can be designated by the user.

SudokuSolver employs two powerful techniques for solving Sudoku puzzles. The first technique is
based on the constraint propagation and search algorithm by Peter Norvig. The second technique is
based on Algorithm X by Donald Knuth. The program employs the first technique by default. However,
the user can choose which technique to use.

Content
----------------------

This package is composed on the following:

- Documented source code files under "src" directory.
- Makefile for building the program.
- Sample Sudoku puzzles in "sample_puzzles.csv" file.
- README file (this file).
- AUTHORS file.


----------------------
How To Use the Program
----------------------

To use the program, open a terminal in the projects directory and execute the "make" command. This
should build the program executable "SudokuSolver". To run the program, simply execute the following
command:

  ./SudokuSolver -f <input-file-name>

The program has other options to customize its behavior. They are as follows:

- The program outputs the results in a file called "sudoku_output.txt" by default. If you want
to designate a different output file, use the '-o' option as follows: -o <output-file-name>.

- If you want to select which technique to use, use the '-t' option as follows: -t [1|2].
Code '1' is for the constraint propagation technique. Code '2' is for Algorithm X.

- If you want to know how much time is spent computing a puzzle, use the '-p' option to record and
output the processing time for each puzzle.

- If you want to have the results displayed on the terminal, use the '-d' option.


The program displays simple status messages during execution. The program can also detect erroneous
puzzles and other invalid states and will issue a corresponding error message.

Platform and Support
----------------------

SudokuSolver has been developed and tested on a GNU/Linux Debian 7.6 x86_64 machine. This program
relies on C++11 features.
